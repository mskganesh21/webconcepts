fixed: create a button and fix it in the right bottom 
display: fixed;
bottom: 0;
right: 0;

top,right,bottom and left work only with positions.

position: sticky


sticky vs fixed
fixed is always fixed
sticky becomes sticky only at the mentioned co ordinates



position absolute
top:0;
right:0;

relative ensures that child elements (absolute) move inside the parent element

we can put as many absolute inside 1 relative position
